#  My user guide/operating manual

This is the user guide or a “manager readme” for anyone who works directly for me. I offer this to you because I recognise that the faster we get to know each other and how we work, the better and stronger our relationship will be, and the more we’ll accomplish together. This document is not a replacement for us getting to know each other; it’s intended to get you up to speed with how I like to work asap. *Note: This is a living document that will change as I learn more.*

### My Values
I place a strong emphasis on the following values and try to infuse all that I do with them:
- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Pragmatism

### Communication
- It’s important that we communicate well and often. I find that the vast majority of issues are a result of poor or infrequent communication. 
- Hierarchy of communication (most → least urgent): Face to Face→Zoom/Call→ Slack→Email. 
- I will always try and make myself available if you need me. I consider my time with you (my direct reports) amongst my most important time. If you suggest a meeting or discussion, initiate finding a time and make an appointment on my calendar. If I suggest a discussion, I will initiate finding the time.
- I don’t expect you to respond to everything in real-time, but I do expect you to close the loop on everything we open. If it’s on my plate, I will do the same, but try to take things off my plate and into your own system that you can create transparency around. 
- *I can get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice.*
- Context is critical to sharing your work. I am always interested in the reason why you believe what you believe. All of us have a method by which we take in information and output a decision or position. Share your logic, particularly as we are building trust; whether you’re basing your position on precedent, other industries, or from first principles. I don’t mind over-communication, it’s critically important we learn how we think, so do share as much as you can.
- 
### Reporting
- Create a regular, systematic, clearly framed process by which you share your progress against plan. Collaborate with me on this. Make it as quantitative as possible. I may need to communicate this progress to others.
- This reporting is separate to 1 to 1 meetings (see below)
- Share this update no less frequently than weekly.
- I appreciate where data is used to describe your results.

### 1 to 1 Meetings
- We’ll do this weekly or bi-weekly for at least 30 minutes (unless you specifically prefer a different cadence and running time - let me know)
- You should maintain a running Google Doc or Sheet that we collaborate on.
- 1 to 1s are mostly your time and your agenda, and if time permits, I will have some questions, where possible I will add this to the agenda too.
- I like using 1 to 1s to check-in on how you’re doing, what you need from me, people issues, more general questions that we can seed or discuss, training needs, discussing concerns from what you shared in your written progress reports or holes in the reporting, me providing any missing context from the Exec meetings or elsewhere, and bi-directional feedback. I believe peer to peer accountability around performance is more powerful than accountability to me, so it’s more important that you create transparency to those affected by your results, in addition to me.
- 1 to 1s are not progress updates - as mentioned you should create a mechanism to share this with me.
- A big and important part of my job is helping you to be successful, so use me for that as much as you want.

### Your Role as a Leader
As leaders, you will need to influence the team to change, improve, or add processes and tools to our systems. At times, you may need to change the mindset or beliefs of your team as you help them improve the way they approach making quality software.

I am committed to helping you become better leaders, and where possible, we’ll talk about leadership and influence frequently during our 1 to 1s. I expect you to let me know your challenges, and I will do everything I can to help you succeed as you address those challenges. I am here for advice and ideas to help you as needed, but I have complete trust in you to lead your team from a quality point of view.

### Meeting Protocol

- I go to a lot of meetings. My calendar is publicly visible. If you have a question about a meeting on my calendar, ask me. If a meeting is private or confidential, its title and attendees will be hidden from your view. The vast majority of my meetings are neither private nor confidential.
- My definition of a meeting includes an agenda or intended purpose, the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will always try to start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance.
- If you send me a document a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read it, I will tell you.
- If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

### How I manage
The following two key points sum up a large part of my management approach.

### 1. Our relationship is a collaboration
Your relationship with me as a manager is a mutually beneficial deal for both of us. Our goal is to add value to each other, and we will help each other be successful. I will help you grow in your career and help you become more valuable to Antidote while you make Antidote successful. 

### 2. Independence and coaching
Your success relies on your independence and autonomy. My role as a manager is to provide a framework you can work in (e.g. help define your role and mission), and then get out of your way as much as possible. Antidote employees are capable of working with others and figuring things out - I’m here for guidance, coaching, and to help otherwise as needed. If you have questions - or need advice - or just someone to bounce an idea off of, I’m always available. I will also step in and apply additional guidance from time to time. It doesn’t mean you’ve made a mistake or you’re doing something wrong - it just means that I spotted an opportunity where I think I can help you. 

### How I expect you to approach your job
I expect you to operate as a [Directly Responsible Individual](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4). Antidote hired you because of your experience and skills, and I am not here to tell you how to do your job. I believe you are able to operate as a professional adult, and make smart decisions. This does not mean that I expect you to do everything on your own - I am here to provide you guidance and mentorship (either through me or by finding the people you should be getting it from). When you need help, I expect you not to hesitate and ask for it. If you feel you made a mistake, own up to it.

### Process
I strongly believe in putting people over process and changing process to accommodate our needs and goals. I need certain processes in place to be able to manage up and out to the rest of the organisation; however, I do not believe in process for the sake of process. I know that what works for one team, will not work for another - and I know that dictating process is not ideal. I will attempt to improve process, but I want to make sure that any changes I make are beneficial for all parties. If you ever have feedback on process - please let me know - I want the team to operate at it’s best at all times, and having a process that makes sense for everyone is critical.

### Housekeeping
- I can talk anytime if something is urgent
- When you go on leave, let me know how I can help or what could go wrong. 
- Keep your calendar current, make your calendar responses status accurate (i.e., don’t accept meetings you can’t attend, say tentative if not sure)
